	<h2>Undergraduate research: get involved</h2>
	<p>Careers in science often start by working in a lab while an undergraduate, which can be a fantastic experience in its own right, along with being a gateway to both graduate school and medical school. There are many programs that support undergraduate research, both at UMD, at local institutions such as NIH, and more broadly. Should you decide to try the next level, most science graduate schools (outside of professional schools like medical school) are free, and even pay you.</p>
