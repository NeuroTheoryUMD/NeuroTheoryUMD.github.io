			<p><h3>We are a computational and theoretical neuroscience research group at the University of Maryland College Park, studying the complex computations underlying natural intelligence, and how they are implemented by neural systems. We primarily interested in understanding <i></i>natural</i> sensory processing, including: how computations -- and resulting representations -- are organized across the sensory hierarchy, how they are modulated by top-down influences related to behavioral context, and how this is leveraged by active sensation. We combine cutting-edge approaches in statistical computation and machine learning combined with state-of-the-art experimental neurophysiology recorded in collaboration with local, national and international collaborators.</h3></p>
			<br>
			<p><b>OPEN POSTDOC POSITION.</b> We have an open position for a postdoctoral fellow to study high-acuity vision combining large-scale electrophysiology and deep computational modeling in collaboration with the <a href="https://irp.nih.gov/pi/bevil-conway" target="_new">Conway lab (NIH)</a>. Prior experience in related areas (broadly speaking) is necessary, which must include some background in both neuroscience and machine learning. If interested, please email <a href="PeoplePages/dbutts">Dan Butts</a> with a CV and brief research statement.</p>

			<p><b>GRADUATE STUDENTS.</b> We have open positions for <i>Ph.D.</i> students to work on <a href="research.html">ongoing research projects</a>. We recruit through many UMD graduate programs including <a href="https://nacs.umd.edu/" target="_new">Neuroscience (NACS)</a>, <a href="https://amsc.umd.edu" target="_new">Applied Math (AMSC)</a>, <a href="https://ipst.umd.edu/graduate-programs/biophysics" target="_new">Biophysics</a>, and <a href="https://ece.umd.edu/graduate" target="_new">Electrical and Computer Engineering</a>. <i>Note that all admissions occurs in the Fall, and <b>we are unable to support shorter term positions</b>.</i> Please contact <a href="PeoplePages/dbutts">Dan Butts</a> if you are interested in applying.</p>

			<p><b>UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH POSITIONS.</b> There are opportunities for talented undergraduates to be involved in research projects in the lab, <i><b>given sufficient background</b></i> in computer programming and applications of mathematics coursework up through linear algebra. Note that undergraduate positions will typically require more than a one-year research commitment, and short-term positions are not available. Please contact <a href="PeoplePages/dbutts">Dan Butts</a> if you are interested, and please <i>be sure to send relevant information</i> about your experience in math and CS.</p>
